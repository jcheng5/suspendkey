SuspendKey.exe adds three system-wide shortcuts to Windows:

Windows+Z - Sleep
Windows+Alt+Z - Hibernate
Shift+Alt+Z - Turn monitor off

These shortcuts only work when SuspendKey.exe is actually running, so you'll want to make sure it gets run whenever you log in to Windows. [TODO: Link to instructions]

I've only tested on Windows 7 but it seems like it should work on 2000, XP, and Vista as well.
